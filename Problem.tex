Let us consider a control system, 
\begin{align}
	\dot{x} = f(t,x,u), \label{eq:control system}
\end{align}
 for $x$ in some metric space $X$ and $u$ in some convex space $U$.
 In order to discuss robustness for nonlinear control systems we propose the following definition:
\begin{definition}
	For a state $x_{f} \in X$, the time-$T$ backwards reachable set is the subset
	\begin{align*}
		\BRS_{T}( x_{f} ) := \{ x_{0} \in X \mid& \exists u(\cdot) , x(\cdot) \text{ such that } \\
			&\quad \dot{x}(t) = f(t,x(t),u(t)) ,\\
			&\quad x(0) = x_{0}, x(T) = x_{T}  \}.
	\end{align*}
	For a set $\Gamma \subset X$ we define $\BRS_{T}(\Gamma) = \cup_{x \in \Gamma} \BRS_{T}(x)$.
	Finally, given a radius $r > 0$ we say that $\Gamma$ is $r$-Robust at time $T$ if $N_{r}( \Gamma) \subset \BRS_{T}( \Gamma )$,
	where $N_{r}( \cdot)$ refers to the $r$-neighborhood with respect to the metric on $X$.
\end{definition}

We will assume that there are a range of feasible periodic orbits $\{ \Gamma_{\alpha} \}_{\alpha \in A}$ with respect to some indexing set $A$
which we wish to optimize over.
That is to say each $\Gamma_{\alpha} \in C^{0}( S^{1} ; X)$.
A measure of efficiency on periodic trajectories, $\mathcal{E}: C^{0}( S^{1} ; X) \to \mathbb{R}$ then induces a function $E:A\to \mathbb{R}$ given by
\begin{align*}
	E( \alpha) := \mathcal{E}( \Gamma_{\alpha}).
\end{align*}
We then seek to find the most efficient trajectory $\Gamma_{\alpha}$ subject to the constraint that the corresponding orbit, $\Gamma_{\alpha}(S^{1})$ is robust.
In summary, we desire to solve the (typically non-convex) optimization problem
\begin{align*}
	p^{*} = \sup_{\alpha} E(\alpha) \\
\intertext{subject to the constraint}
	N_{r}(\Gamma_{\alpha}) \subset \BRS_{T}(\Gamma_{\alpha}).
\end{align*}
for some pre-chosen $r >0$ and $T>0$.
