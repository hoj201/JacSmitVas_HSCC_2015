A reasonable solution to \eqref{eq:nonconvex} could involve convexifying this optimization problem.
This is the primary aim of this section.  Upon convexifying \eqref{eq:nonconvex} we may solve it using standard numerical convex optimization routines.

To begin, let us introduce the space of measures $\mathcal{M}(X) \equiv C(X)'$ where $C(X)$ is the space of continuous functions.
