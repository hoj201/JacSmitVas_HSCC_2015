A reasonable solution to \eqref{eq:nonconvex} could involve convexifying this optimization problem.
This is the primary aim of this section.  Upon convexifying \eqref{eq:nonconvex} we may solve it using standard numerical convex optimization routines.
In particular we will consider the optimization problem
\begin{align*}
	\sup \int E(\alpha) d\sigma(\alpha)
\end{align*}
for a measure $\sigma \in \mathcal{M}(A)$ with respect to the constraints
\begin{align*}
	\mu_{0} \otimes \delta_{0} + \mathcal{L}' \mu = \mu_{T} \otimes \delta_{T} \\
	\int_{A} d\sigma(\alpha) = 1 \\
	\mu_{0} \geq \int_{A} 1_{R}(x,\alpha) d\sigma(\alpha) \\
	\operatorname{spt}(\mu_{T}) \subset X_{T} \\
\end{align*}

{\color{red}  It is not clear that $\sigma$ is really constrained by the $\mu$'s.  Also, the third constraint compares a function and a measure}
