Let us consider a control system, 
\begin{align}
	\dot{x} = f(t,x,u), \label{eq:control system}
\end{align}
 for $x$ in some metric space $X$ and $u$ in some convex space $U$.
 In order to discuss robustness for nonlinear control systems we propose the following definition:
\begin{definition}
    For a state $x_{f} \in X$, the time-$T$ \emph{backwards reachable set} is the subset
	\begin{align*}
		\BRS_{T}( x_{f} ) := \{ x_{0} \in X \mid& \exists u(\cdot) , x(\cdot) \text{ such that } \\
			&\quad \dot{x}(t) = f(t,x(t),u(t)) ,\\
			&\quad x(0) = x_{0}, x(T) = x_{T}  \}.
	\end{align*}
	For a set $\Gamma \subset X$ we define $\BRS_{T}(\Gamma) = \cup_{x \in \Gamma} \BRS_{T}(x)$.
        Given a radius $r > 0$ we say that $\Gamma$ is \emph{$r$-Robust} at time $T$ if $N_{r}( \Gamma) \subset \BRS_{T}( \Gamma )$,
	where $N_{r}( \cdot)$ refers to the $r$-neighborhood with respect to the metric on $X$.
\end{definition}

The goal of this paper is to optimize some measure of efficiency subject to a robustness constraint.
The efficiency of a trajectory $(x(t),u(t))$ is given by a user specified functional, $\mathcal{E}[x(\cdot),u(\cdot)]$.  Given an $r>0$ we could then aim to solve the optimization problem
\begin{align*}
    p^* = \sup_{u(\cdot),x(\cdot)} \mathcal{E}[ u(\cdot),x(\cdot) ]
\end{align*}
subject to the contraint that $\dot{x} = f(t,x,u)$ and that the orbit $\Gamma = x( [0,T])$ is $r$-robust.

This nonlinear infinite dimensional optimization problem is infeasible for us to solve, and so we consider a more modest problem which we can solve.
Rather than considering the space of all feasible trajectories,
we shall restrict ourselves to some finitely parametrizable subset.
In particular we will assume that there are a range of feasible trajectories $\{ \Gamma_{\alpha} \}_{\alpha \in A}$ with respect to some (tractable) indexing set $A$
which we wish to optimize over.
The efficiency, $\mathcal{E}$, can then be written as a function on $A$ given by
\begin{align*}
	E( \alpha) := \mathcal{E}( \Gamma_{\alpha}).
\end{align*}
We then seek to find the most efficient trajectory $\Gamma_{\alpha}$ subject to the constraint that the corresponding orbit, $\Gamma_{\alpha}(S^{1})$ is robust.
In summary, we desire to solve the (typically non-convex) optimization problem
\begin{align}
	p^{*} = \sup_{\alpha} E(\alpha) \label{eq:nonconvex}\\
\intertext{subject to the constraint}
	N_{r}(\Gamma_{\alpha}) \subset \BRS_{T}(\Gamma_{\alpha}). \nonumber
\end{align}
for some pre-chosen $r >0$ and $T>0$.
